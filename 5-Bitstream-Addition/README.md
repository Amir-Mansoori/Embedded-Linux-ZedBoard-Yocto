# Bitstream Addition
In this section, we want to add a bitstream file that is generated by Vivado. 
The application is a switch that is connected to an LED through a wire in the Programmable Logic (PL) in Zynq.
Refer to this [page](https://github.com/Amir-Mansoori/Embedded-Linux-ZedBoard-Buildroot/tree/main/4-Bitstream-addition#bitstream-addition) for a detailed explanation (it shows the same design in Buildroot).

After completing the design in Vivado and generating the bitstream file, you only need to add the **.xsa** file to a local directory and provide the path that contains this file in **local.conf** file in poky/build/conf/ directory:

```
HDF_BASE = "file://"
HDF_PATH = "<poky_directory>/poky/meta-xilinx-tools/recipes-bsp/hdf/design_1_wrapper.xsa"
```
