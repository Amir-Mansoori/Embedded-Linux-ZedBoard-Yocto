# Embedded-Linux-ZedBoard-Yocto
Step-by-step instructions to creatre embedded linux applications on ZedBoard SoC using Yocto Project

**Yocto Project** provides tools and resources for building custom Linux-based systems for embedded devices. It aims to streamline the development process and ensure consistency across a wide range of embedded platforms. Yocto provides a layering structure that makes it easier to scale and enables better organization and management of project configurations, dependencies, and customizations. Layers can be added or removed to tailor the build to specific project needs.

In this repository, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to configure and bring up linux and develop applications on ZedBoard SoC using Yocto project. Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/Amir-Mansoori/Embedded-Linux-ZedBoard-Buildroot/) for development with Buildroot.
